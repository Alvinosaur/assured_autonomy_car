Questions:
- how ot use lower-dimensional space planning as heuristic  for  higher-dimensional planning

TODO:
- basic lattice-based planner in python
- basic incremental A* that reuses previous G-values
- basic ARA* that iteratively decreases epsilon weighting as time allots
- Double-check that this method will be ok for our use
